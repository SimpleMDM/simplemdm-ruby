# SimpleMDM Ruby bindings

This is a lightweight SDK that acts as a launching point for integrating ruby-based applications with [SimpleMDM](http://www.simplemdm.com/). The native API is a RESTful JSON implementation. These bindings wrap the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simplemdm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simplemdm

## Usage

Full documentation is available here: [http://www.simplemdm.com/docs/api/](http://www.simplemdm.com/docs/api/)

```ruby
require 'simplemdm'

# provide your api key for access

SimpleMDM::api_key = 'j75m8YtUGEaEO5TysjzAXihE07nKoUm9'

# lock a device

device = SimpleMDM::Device.find(23)
device.lock message:      "This device has been locked. Please call the number provided.",
		    phone_number: "5035555847"


# upload an enterprise app and deploy it to a group of devices

data = File.open('surfreport2.2.ipa')
app  = SimpleMDM::App.new name:   "Surf Report",
                          binary: data
app.save

app_group = SimpleMDM::AppGroup.find(37)
app_group.add_app(app)
app_group.push_apps
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
