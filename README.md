# SimpleMDM Ruby bindings

This is a lightweight SDK that acts as a launching point for integrating ruby-based applications with SimpleMDM. The native API is a RESTful JSON implementation. These bindings wrap the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simplemdm-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simplemdm-ruby

## Usage

Full documentation is available here: (http://www.simplemdm.com/docs/api/)[http://www.simplemdm.com/docs/api/]

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
